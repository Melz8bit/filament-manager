# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

FilamentTracker — a Django web app for tracking 3D print filament inventory. Spec: `filament-tracker-spec.md`.

## Common Commands

All Python commands must use the venv interpreter directly (the venv is not auto-activated in shell sessions):

```powershell
# Django dev server
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py runserver

# Migrations
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py makemigrations
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py migrate

# Django system check
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py check

# Tailwind — watch mode (run in a separate terminal alongside runserver)
npm run dev

# Tailwind — production build
npm run build
```

## Architecture

**Django project package:** `config/` — settings, root URLs, wsgi/asgi.  
**Single Django app:** `tracker/` — all models, views, forms, URLs, and templates for MVP features.  
**Templates:** Project-level templates in `templates/` (base layout, auth). App templates in `tracker/templates/tracker/`.  
**Static:** Source CSS at `static/css/src/input.css` → compiled to `static/css/main.css` (gitignored) by Tailwind CLI.  
**Uploads:** `MEDIA_ROOT = uploads/` (gitignored) for `.3mf` and `.gcode` file uploads.

### Key files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `config/settings.py` | All environment config via `python-decouple`; database via `dj-database-url` |
| `tracker/models.py` | `Spool`, `PrintLog`, `PrintSpool` (join table) |
| `tracker/parsers.py` | (Phase 3) `.3mf` and `.gcode` file parsing — pure functions, no Django imports |
| `tracker/utils.py` | (Phase 4) `hex_distance()` and `rank_spools_by_color()` for spool color matching |
| `tracker/constants.py` | `LOW_STOCK_THRESHOLD_G = 100` and other shared constants |

### Data flow

Print logging follows a strict status progression: `queued → pending_assignment → confirmed`. Spool inventory (`remaining_g`) is **never decremented** until status reaches `confirmed`, which happens in a single `transaction.atomic()` block in the spool assignment view.

### Database

SQLite locally (default fallback). Supabase (Postgres) in production — set `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`. Switch is a one-line env var change; no code changes needed.

### Frontend

- Tailwind CSS v3 (Node CLI pipeline, `tailwind.config.js`)
- HTMX 1.9 loaded via CDN in `base.html`; CSRF token injected via `hx-headers` on `<body>`
- `django-htmx` middleware adds `request.htmx` helper in views

## Environment Variables (`.env`)

```
SECRET_KEY=
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=          # blank = SQLite; set to postgres:// for Supabase
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
FORCE_HTTPS=          # defaults to `not DEBUG`; set False when serving plain-http LAN traffic with no local TLS terminator
```

## Deployment

Production runs on a Raspberry Pi (hostname `raspberrypi`, LAN IP `192.168.1.73` as of 2026-07-22 — DHCP, verify with `hostname -I` if unreachable) that also runs OpenMediaVault (NAS) and Plex — this app doesn't have the Pi to itself. Runs via Docker (`compose.yml`, `restart: unless-stopped`), container listens on port 8000.

Public access is via **Cloudflare Tunnel**, not ngrok (ngrok was used originally, fully decommissioned 2026-07-22): tunnel named `homepi`, config at `/etc/cloudflared/config.yml` on the Pi, running as the `cloudflared` systemd service. `https://filament.8bitcode.net` → `http://localhost:8000`. No local reverse proxy (Caddy/Nginx Proxy Manager) needed — `cloudflared` does hostname-based ingress routing itself, so adding another webapp to this Pi later just means a new `hostname:`/`service:` pair in that same ingress config plus `cloudflared tunnel route dns homepi <new-hostname>`.

**Update workflow (automated via CI/CD):** a GitHub Actions self-hosted runner is registered on the Pi (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) — every push to `main` automatically runs `git pull && docker compose up --build -d` on the Pi. No manual deploy step needed; just push. The runner runs as a systemd service under user `pi`, so it stays up across reboots and picks up any pushes made while the Pi was offline.

**Production env file:** `.env.production` lives only on the Pi — it's gitignored (`.env*` pattern) and never committed, so recreate it from `.env.example` if it's ever lost. Key difference from local `.env`: `FORCE_HTTPS=False`, since HTTPS is terminated externally by the Cloudflare Tunnel, not by Django itself (this matters because the app is also reachable via plain `http://` on the LAN, which would otherwise get force-redirected into a broken loop).

## Implementation Status

All 7 phases complete; app is deployed and live (see Deployment above). Plan history at `C:\Users\nival\.claude\plans\read-the-contents-of-idempotent-galaxy.md`.

- [x] Phase 1 — Project scaffolding
- [x] Phase 2 — Spool inventory CRUD
- [x] Phase 3 — File parsing + print log flow
- [x] Phase 4 — Spool assignment screen
- [x] Phase 5 — Print queue
- [x] Phase 6 — Dashboard + print history
- [x] Phase 7 — Manual entry + deployment prep
- [x] Deployed to production (Raspberry Pi, Docker, Cloudflare Tunnel)
